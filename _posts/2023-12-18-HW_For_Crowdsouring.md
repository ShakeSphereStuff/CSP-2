Crowdsouring HW Responce:

1. Crowdsourcing provides a way to achive a large source of data efficiently and through an array of sources. Though with the quality of the data being, lacking, this still can prove effective in gathering data. One of these crowdsourced projects is ImageNet, a database of images and where the objects are in bounding boxes. The result of this project led to 2,025,721 files marked and labled by volenteers with previous data improving the accuracy of the model

2. I've heard this reflected in a Stack Overflow article, yet it rings true of AI, that when we collect all of the data from available sources we will have the most mediocre coder for this AI. While the benifits of crowdsouring are immense, large pool of volunteers, efficent data collection and patches to code they all lack anysort of moderation if kept running. This moderation could allow for higher quality code to subbited to the open source project.  

3. MathJax is an open-source project dealing with providing proper math notation to websites. This global collaberation allows for people to have mathmatical notaiton in the xml svg element, allowing for beautiful math symbols for all magnifications. Along with this it allows for a backbone for exporting to other mathmatical software. One benifit of this is that it allows for speedy patches for bugs in code. A downside of this though is mallicious code being pushed to the final project.

4. Amazon's Mechanical Turk allows for microtask crowdsourcing to be achived through microtasks. This is achived by Mechanical Turk by seperating developer's requests into tasks of workers to be payed commision from their job. This allows for companys to gather data from a variety of people for an easier and sometimes cheaper operation.

5. A project I chose was ML2022HW3 - Sample Code - Training + Prediction, a code prediction algorithm for python. While the project is still in its early days, we could still use this to write less code by having the AI write the code for us. A couple of ideas for the project are a form of psuedocode and a math solver. These two ideas would benifit from an AI by having the psuedocode by helped by the AI and the Math Solver having either a more dynamic input and / or output
