<div style = "background-color:blue"> 
    <b id = "Testing" style = "color:green; "><br><br>Hello World<br><br></b>
</div>
<script>
    var theText = document.getElementById("Testing")
    theText.innerHTML = "Hello World, how you doing?"
</script> 

- Learned that it's really hard to show javascript in action, did you even know the text was suppost to be "Hello World"?
