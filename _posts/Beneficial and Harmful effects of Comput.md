A relatively recent development in computers is quantum computing, where qubits are used as its unit of information. Taking advantage of quantum mechanics, quantum computers are much faster and more effective, at especially calculations, than regular supercomputers, which have implications in fields where there are many variables and unknowns.
January 1st, 1983 is considered the birthday of the Internet, and as you all can guess, the Internet connected all computer networks across the globe.
Consider this hypothetical scenario. 15 years from now, Team WRONG is planning to launch a new virtual reality system to be streamline gaming and make the experience more immersive.
