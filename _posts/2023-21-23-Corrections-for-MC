While doing the corrections I found out a few things about my test taking which didn't seem obvious

So let's go in order of most obvious to least for what I've learned for my test corrections

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Stuff that hasn't been taught in CSP
        </td>
        <td>
            Pretty obvious, would have a difficult time if it hadn't been taught to me i.e. #29, 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Content I knew, that I just didn't properly apply 
        </td>
        <td>
            This was inevitable, coming from math, where that happens every test, this makes sense I made some easily avoidable mistakes, i.e. #18 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Being horrible at being my own compiler
        </td>
        <td>
            This makes sense the way I code, where I trust the compiler to make my silly mistakes, yet that was painful when a bit of misleading triped me up yet I would have not initialy known that this was a problem i.e. #15
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Me still not understanding college board answers
        </td>
        <td>
            For question #6, it feels arbitary for both algorithms to be the solution for the question when algorithm 1 works just as well, yet I was marked down for that solution
        </td>
    </tr>

</table>

Through these test corrections I was able to understand what I needed to work on, Content I didn't apply properly and questions that help me parse through code easier
