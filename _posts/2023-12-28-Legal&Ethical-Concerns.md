1. Describe the key differences between the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Open Source MIT License, and Open Source GPL License.

The Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal allows for everyone to use the work for commercial purposes, along with distributing, copying and modifying the work.

Open Source MIT License allows for the same communication as said above with the added attachment of acknowledging the orginal licence and orginal source of which you copied

The Open Source GPL License then only restricts you to two princables; freedom to modify software, and to share the changes you make

2. Give examples that illustrate how companies, such as Qualcomm and Red Hat, have leveraged Open Source licenses to establish unique business models.

Qualcomm wants to collect royalties, which has it constantly scouering the web for code they have developed.

Red Hat has the intresting way of making money through offering a free operating system, yet with other operations that cost money that they provide

3. Why are businesses that heavily rely on Open Source software still need to generate income and how they manage this within the constraints of Open Source licenses.

Red Hat has their way of providing Open Source software through other add-ons and servers to use with their software, simmilar to the razer and blade approch except more exaggerated.
