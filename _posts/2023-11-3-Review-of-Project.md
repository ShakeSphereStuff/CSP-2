What I've learned over the project:

Parts of Firebase
Management of Elements in CSS
The VH elements
Practical Experience

Firebase:
    Over the course of this project I've learned firebase setting and and creating of object, those being

            db.update({
                Code
            })
    and 
            db.set({
                code
            })
    db.update allowed for real time updating of the database allowing for real time liking. db.set allowed for the creation of variables to the data base, the ones we used being likes, timestamp, message, username, handle, pfp. Using these two allowed for online communication for free!

Managment of Elements in CSS:
    Though deleted in the final version, I used float: left; and display: inline-block to have the like button next to text. Through this I am able to learn more about how to reformat sites in the future

The VH elements:
    While working on the help page I ran into the VH element. This element uses percents for the viewport. This is helpful because it gives me another css way to develop webpages

Practical Experience:
    This is to show how developing smaller parts of the webpage helped me. One of the first things I did was to find a way of getting the header to pop back down after posting. Through this I was able to learn how to understand code from another person and be able to improve it in some small way
