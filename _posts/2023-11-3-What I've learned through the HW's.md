.index()
This is a tool that allows me to find the index of something by searching the term

Importance of useable variables:
From the HW's I've learned of the importance of having variables that I can understand, as seen in boolean and conditons

Accessing 2d dictionaries:
I learned through this that I could access 2d dictionaries through ["String"]["String"] and not ["String"["String"]] This has proved helpful because it allowed me for the requirements of the grader

global keyword:
From the project that was suppost to be for our team teach I wrote a nearly 200 line starter script that was suppost to be built on, but was then repurposed for a HW. From this I learned that the global keymord allows for definitions to be interacted from one another.

break & continue statements:
Though I knew what these were, the way I've utilized them is something that wasn't initaly what I thought and helped me when making multiple projects

try & except:
Came in useful during the grader algorithm, didn't know the notation until now
