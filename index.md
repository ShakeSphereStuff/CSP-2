    What I had
    Something with Python Ravager
    Something with Google App Script SpreadSheets
    Something With VS Code Text thing

 -->

## Python Ravager

![Image of Ravager in ASCII text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zUJWEJbUrnTEs920yKckb4u5uemQDyHK)

This was done through having multiple variables, each assigned to a print statement, and then was fed to a large string

## Google App Script, 400+ Spreadsheets

![Spreadsheet of 400 urls of Spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_q3nohOAyDd2JETmu4P2OXiA87PxBsmB)

This was done through using SpreadSheetApp.create(), then modifying each of them into a central folder, linking to the main spreadsheet, in image and having text to in theory store everybody's id if they started with 19

## VSCode, 2D Image

This was orginaly built in Python before ported over into Javascript, what I have now is a circle built on pythagreom therom, WASD controls, and rotation.m




- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
